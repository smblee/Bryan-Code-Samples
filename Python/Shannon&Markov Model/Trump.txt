IT IS NOT EASY. HE IS DOING A HELLUVA JOB. MY SECOND HOME IS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD IN YOUR COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY KNOWN AS PALM BEACH. I LOVE FLORIDA. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SOUTH FLORIDA TEA PARTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS GROUP OF HARD-WORKING, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. IT IS MY GREAT HONOR, BELIEVE ME. [APPLAUSE]
